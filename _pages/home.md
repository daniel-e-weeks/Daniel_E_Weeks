### Welcome!

I am a Professor of Human Genetics, with a joint appointment in the Department of Biostatistics
and Health Data Science.  My research interests include statistical genetics, genetics of complex disease, epigenetics. Areas of application include adiposity, recovery from brain injury, breast cancer.

### About me

Dr. Weeks' research focuses on statistical human genetics in the area of mapping susceptibility loci involved in complex diseases. His primary interest is developing new mapping methods, which involves developing algorithms and statistics, implementing them in computer programs, and testing them on real and simulated data. In addition, he is actively involved in a number of collaborative human genetics projects, all of which constantly challenge him to develop new and more useful methods for dealing with the complexities of real data. He is studying the genetic influences on obesity, lipids, and body composition. In addition, he and his colleagues are studying the effects of methylation on patient recovery outcomes after traumatic brain injury, and on cognitive function within the context of treatment for breast cancer.
