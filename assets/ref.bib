	title = {Improving imputation quality in {Samoans} through the integration of population-specific sequences into existing reference panels},
	doi = {10.1101/2023.10.31.23297835},
	abstract = {Genotype imputation is fundamental to association studies, and yet even gold standard panels like TOPMed are limited in the populations for which they yield good imputation. Specifically, Pacific Islanders are poorly represented in extant panels. To address this, we constructed an imputation reference panel using 1,285 Samoan individuals with whole-genome sequencing, combined with 1000 Genomes (1000G) samples, to create a reference panel that better represents Pacific Islander, specifically Samoan, genetic variation. We compared this panel to 1000G and TOPMed panels based on imputed variants using genotyping array data for 1,834 Samoan participants who were not part of the panels. The 1000G + 1285 Samoan panel yielded up to 2.25-2.76 times more well-imputed (r 2 ≥ 0.80) variants than TOPMed and 1000G. There was improved imputation accuracy across the minor allele frequency (MAF) spectrum, although it was more pronounced for variants with 0.01 ≤ MAF ≤ 0.05. Imputation accuracy (r 2 ) was greater for population-specific variants (high fixation index, F ST ) and those from larger haplotypes (high LD score). The gain in imputation accuracy over TOPMed was largest for small haplotypes (low LD score), reflecting the Samoan panel's ability to capture population-specific variation not well tagged by other panels. We also augmented the 1000G reference panel with varying numbers of Samoan samples and found that panels with 48 or more Samoans included outperformed TOPMed for all variants with MAF ≥ 0.001. This study identifies variants with improved imputation using population-specific reference panels and provides a framework for constructing other population-specific reference panels.},

Objective: To describe daytime sleepiness and insomnia among adults in Samoa and identify modifiable factors associated with these measures.

Design/setting: Cross-sectional analysis of data from the Soifua Manuia ("Good Health") study (n = 519, 55.1% female); Upolu island, Samoa.

Methods: Daytime sleepiness and insomnia were assessed with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale (WHIIRS), respectively. Detailed physical, sociodemographic, and behavioral factors were collected. Sleep measures were characterized using multiple linear regression with backwards elimination and a bootstrap stability investigation.

Results: Excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS>10) and insomnia (WHIIRS>10) were reported by 20% and 6.3% of the sample, respectively. ESS scores were higher in individuals reporting more physical activity (Estimate=1.88; 95% CI=1.12 to 2.75), higher material wealth (0.18; 0.09 to 0.28), and asthma (2.85; 1.25 to 4.51). ESS scores were lower in individuals residing in periurban versus urban regions (-1.43; -2.39 to -0.41), reporting no work versus day shift work (-2.26; -3.07 to -1.41), and reporting greater perceived stress (-0.14; -0.23 to -0.06). WHIIRS scores were lower in individuals reporting "other" shift work (split/irregular/on-call/rotating) versus day shift work (-1.96; -2.89 to -1.14) and those who perceived their village's wealth to be poor/average versus wealthy (-0.94; -1.50 to -0.34).

Conclusions: Participants had a generally higher prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness, but lower prevalence of insomnia, compared with individuals from high-income countries. Factors associated with sleep health differed compared with prior studies, emphasizing potential cultural/environmental differences and the need for targeted interventions to improve sleep health in this setting.

	doi = {10.1002/ajhb.23838},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In 1999, a set of highly accurate Polynesian-specific equations to estimate adult body fat from non-invasive field measures of age, sex, height, and weight (Equation 1), age, sex, height, weight, and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) resistance (Equation 2), and age, sex, height, weight, and the sum of two skinfold thicknesses (Equation 3) were published. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the equation-based estimators in a sample of Samoan adults recruited 20 years later between 2017 and 2019.
METHODS: Age, sex, height, weight, BIA resistance, skinfold thickness, and fat mass as measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were available for 432 Samoan adults (mean age 50.9 years, 56% female) seen in 2017/2019. We compared equation-derived fat mass and DXA-derived fat mass using scatterplots and Pearson correlation coefficients. We then updated the equation coefficient estimates in a training set (2/3 of the sample) and evaluated the performance of the updated equations in a testing set (the remaining 1/3 of the sample).
RESULTS: Equation-derived fat mass was strongly correlated with DXA-derived fat mass for Equation (1) (r2  = 0.95, n = 432), Equation (2) (r2  = 0.97, n = 425), and Equation (3) (r2  = 0.95, n = 426). Updating the equation coefficient estimates resulted in mostly similar coefficients and nearly identical testing set performance for Equation (1) (r2  = 0.96, n = 153), Equation (2) (r2  = 0.98, n = 150), and Equation (3) (r2  = 0.96, n = 150).
CONCLUSIONS: The Polynesian-specific body fat estimation equations remained stable despite changing social and environmental factors and marked increase in obesity prevalence in Samoa.},

	abstract = {Current understanding of lipid genetics has come mainly from studies in European-ancestry populations; limited effort has focused on Polynesian populations, whose unique population history and high prevalence of dyslipidemia may provide insight into the biological foundations of variation in lipid levels. Here, we performed an association study to fine map a suggestive association on 5q35 with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) seen in Micronesian and Polynesian populations. Fine-mapping analyses in a cohort of 2,851 Samoan adults highlighted an association between a stop-gain variant (rs200884524; c.652C>T, p.R218∗; posterior probability = 0.9987) in BTNL9 and both lower HDL-C and greater triglycerides (TGs). Meta-analysis across this and several other cohorts of Polynesian ancestry from Samoa, American Samoa, and Aotearoa New Zealand confirmed the presence of this association (βHDL-C = -1.60 mg/dL, p HDL-C = 7.63 × 10-10; βTG = 12.00 mg/dL, p TG = 3.82 × 10-7). While this variant appears to be Polynesian specific, there is also evidence of association from other multiancestry analyses in this region. This work provides evidence of a previously unexplored contributor to the genetic architecture of lipid levels and underscores the importance of genetic analyses in understudied populations. },

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) is intrinsically linked to fluid volume homeostasis and blood pressure. Specific rare mutations in SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G, genes encoding the α, β, and γ subunits of ENaC, respectively, are associated with extreme blood pressure phenotypes. No associations between blood pressure and SCNN1D, which encodes the δ subunit of ENaC, have been reported. A small number of sequence variants in ENaC subunits have been reported to affect functional transport in vitro or blood pressure. The effects of the vast majority of rare and low-frequency ENaC variants on blood pressure are not known.
METHODS: We explored the association of low frequency and rare variants in the genes encoding ENaC subunits, with systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and pulse pressure. Using whole-genome sequencing data from 14 studies participating in the Trans-Omics in Precision Medicine Whole-Genome Sequencing Program, and sequence kernel association tests.
RESULTS: We found that variants in SCNN1A and SCNN1B were associated with diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure (P{\textless}0.00625). Although SCNN1D is poorly expressed in human kidney tissue, SCNN1D variants were associated with systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and pulse pressure (P{\textless}0.00625). ENaC variants in 2 of the 4 subunits (SCNN1B and SCNN1D) were also associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (P{\textless}0.00625), but not with stroke.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that variants in extrarenal ENaCs, in addition to ENaCs expressed in kidneys, influence blood pressure and kidney function.},

	doi = {10.1002/oby.23559},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to understand whether the paradoxical association of missense variant rs373863828 in CREB3 regulatory factor (CREBRF) with higher BMI but lower odds of diabetes is explained by either metabolically favorable body fat distribution or greater fat-free mass.
METHODS: This study explored the association of the minor allele with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry-derived body composition in n = 421 Samoans and used path analysis to examine the mediating role of fat and fat-free mass on the relationship between rs373863828 and fasting glucose.
RESULTS: Among females, the rs373863828 minor A allele was associated with greater BMI. There was no association of genotype with percent body fat, visceral adiposity, or fat distribution in either sex. In both females and males, lean mass was greater with each A allele: 2.16 kg/copy (p = 0.0001) and 1.73 kg/copy (p = 0.02), respectively. Path analysis showed a direct negative effect of rs373863828 genotype on fasting glucose (p = 0.004) consistent with previous findings, but also an indirect positive effect on fasting glucose operating through fat-free mass (p = 0.027).
CONCLUSIONS: The protective effect of rs373863828 in CREBRF, common among Pacific Islanders, on type 2 diabetes does not operate through body composition. Rather, the variant's effects on body size/composition and fasting glucose likely operate via different, tissue-specific mechanisms.},

The National Center for Biotechnology Information's Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) is a public repository for scientific data sharing. To support curation of thousands of complex data sets, dbGaP has detailed submission instructions that investigators must follow when archiving their data.
RESULTS: We developed dbGaPCheckup, an R package which implements a series of check, awareness, reporting, and utility functions to support data integrity and proper formatting of the subject phenotype data set and data dictionary prior to dbGaP submission. For example, as a tool, dbGaPCheckup ensures that the data dictionary contains all fields required by dbGaP, and additional fields required by dbGaPCheckup; the number and names of variables match between the data set and data dictionary; there are no duplicated variable names or descriptions; observed data values are not more extreme than the logical minimum and maximum values stated in the data dictionary; and more. The package also includes functions that implement a series of minor/scalable fixes when errors are detected (e.g., a function to reorder the variables in the data dictionary to match the order listed in the data set). Finally, we also include reporting functions that produce graphical and textual descriptives of the data to further reduce the likelihood of data integrity issues. The dbGaPCheckup R package is available on CRAN ( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dbGaPCheckup ) and developed on GitHub ( https://github.com/lwheinsberg/dbGaPCheckup ).
CONCLUSION: dbGaPCheckup is an innovative assistive and timesaving tool that fills an important gap for researchers by making dbGaP submission of large and complex data sets less error prone.},

	abstract = {Background
              While preeclampsia (PE) is a leading cause of pregnancy-related morbidity/mortality, its underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. DNA methylation (DNAm) is a dynamic regulator of gene expression that may offer insight into PE pathophysiology and/or serve as a biomarker (e.g., risk, subtype, a therapeutic response). This study’s purpose was to evaluate for differences in blood-based DNAm across all trimesters between individuals eventually diagnosed with PE (cases) and individuals who remained normotensive throughout pregnancy, did not develop proteinuria, and birthed a normally grown infant (controls).
            
Results
              In the discovery phase, longitudinal, genome-wide DNAm data were generated across three trimesters of pregnancy in 56 participants (n=28 cases, n=28 controls) individually matched on self-identified race, pre-pregnancy body mass index, smoking, and gestational age at sample collection. An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was conducted, using surrogate variable analysis to account for unwanted sources of variation. No CpGs met the genome-wide significance p value threshold of 9×10^-8, but 16 CpGs (trimester 1: 5; trimester 2: 1; trimester 3: 10) met the suggestive significance threshold of 1×10^-5. DNAm data were also evaluated for differentially methylated regions (DMRs) by PE status. Three DMRs in each trimester were significant after Bonferonni-adjustment. Since only third-trimester samples were available from an independent replication sample (n=64 cases,n=50 controls), the top suggestive hits from trimester 3 (cg16155413 and cg21882990 associated with TRAF3IP2-AS1/TRAF3IP2 genes, which also made up the top DMR) were carried forward for replication. During replication, DNAm data were also generated for validation purposes from discovery phase third trimester samples. While significant associations between DNAm and PE status were observed at both sites in the validation sample, no associations between DNAm and PE status were observed in the independent replication sample.
                          
Conclusions
              The discovery phase findings for cg16155413/cg21882990 (TRAF3IP2-AS1/TRAF3IP2) were validated with a new platform but were not replicated in an independent sample. Given the differences in participant characteristics between the discovery and replication samples, we cannot rule out important signals for these CpGs. Additional research is warranted for cg16155413/cg21882990, as well as top hits in trimesters 1–2 and significant DMRs that were not examined in the replication phase.},

Despite increasing research, little attention has been given to studying PFAS contamination in low- and middle-income countries, including Samoa. Using data and biosamples collected through the Foafoaga o le Ola ("Beginning of Life") Study, which recruited a sample of mothers and infants from Samoa, we conducted an exploratory study to describe concentrations of 40 PFAS analytes in infant cord blood collected at birth (n = 66) and infant dried blood spots (DBS) collected at 4 months post-birth (n = 50). Of the 40 PFAS analytes tested, 19 were detected in cord blood, with 10 detected in {\textgreater}50\% of samples (PFBA, PFPeA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnA, PFTrDA, PFHxS, PFOS, and 9Cl-PF3ONS); and 12 analytes were detected in DBS, with 3 detected in {\textgreater}50\% of samples (PFBA, PFHxS, and PFOS). PFAS concentrations were generally lower than those reported in existing literature, with the exception of PFHxS, which was detected at higher concentrations. In cord blood, we noted suggestive (p {\textless} 0.05) or significant (p {\textless} 0.006) associations between higher PFHxS and male sex; higher PFPeA and residence in Northwest 'Upolu (NWU) compared to the Apia Urban Area (AUA); lower PFUnA and 9Cl-PF3ONS and greater socioeconomic resources; lower PFOA and higher parity; higher PFDA and higher maternal age; and lower PFUnA, PFTrDA, and 9Cl-PF3ONS and higher maternal BMI. In DBS, we found suggestive (p {\textless} 0.05) or significant (p {\textless} 0.025) associations between lower PFBA and residence in NWU versus AUA; lower PFBA and PFHxS and higher maternal age; and higher PFBA and higher maternal BMI. Finally, we observed associations between nutrition source at 4 months and DBS PFBA and PFHxS, with formula- or mixed-fed infants having higher concentrations compared to exclusively breastfed infants. This study represents the first characterization of PFAS contamination in Samoa. Additional work in larger samples is needed to identify potentially modifiable determinants of PFAS concentrations, information that is critical for informing environmental and health policy measures.},

	abstract = {Background The A allele of rs373863828 in CREB3 regulatory factor is associated with high Body Mass Index, but lower odds of type 2 diabetes. These associations have been replicated elsewhere, but to date all studies have been cross-sectional. Our aims were (1) to describe the development of type 2 diabetes and change in fasting glucose between 2010 and 2018 among a longitudinal cohort of adult Samoans without type 2 diabetes or who were not using diabetes medications at baseline, and (2) to examine associations between fasting glucose rate-of-change (mmol/L per year) and the A allele of rs373863828. Methods We describe and test differences in fasting glucose, the development of type 2 diabetes, body mass index, age, smoking status, physical activity, urbanicity of residence, and household asset scores between 2010 and 2018 among a cohort of n = 401 adult Samoans, selected to have a {\textasciitilde}2:2:1 ratio of GG:AG: AA rs373863828 genotypes. Multivariate linear regression was used to test whether fasting glucose rate-of-change was associated with rs373863828 genotype, and other baseline variables. Results By 2018, fasting glucose and BMI significantly increased among all genotype groups, and a substantial portion of the sample developed type 2 diabetes mellitus. The A allele was associated with a lower fasting glucose rate-of-change (β = −0.05 mmol/L/year per allele, p = 0.058 among women; β = −0.004 mmol/L/year per allele, p = 0.863 among men), after accounting for baseline variables. Mean fasting glucose and mean BMI increased over an eight-year period and a substantial number of individuals developed type 2 diabetes by 2018. However, fasting glucose rate-of-change, and type 2 diabetes development was lower among females with AG and AA genotypes. Conclusions Further research is needed to understand the effect of the A allele on fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes development. Based on our observations that other risk factors increased over time, we advocate for the continued promotion for diabetes prevention and treatment programming, and the reduction of modifiable risk factors, in this setting.},

This study used data collected through the Soifua Manuia (“Good Health”) study, which investigated the impact of the body mass index (BMI)-associated genetic variant rs373863828 in CREBRF on metabolic traits in Samoan adults (sampled to overrepresent the obesity-risk allele of interest). A total of 330 participants had sleep data available. Participants (53.3% female) had a mean (SD) age of 52.0 (9.9) years and BMI of 35.5 (7.5) kg/m2, and 36.3\% of the sample had type 2 diabetes. Based on the 3% and 4% apnea hypopnea indices (AHI) and the 4% oxygen desaturation index (ODI), descriptive analyses revealed moderate to severe sleep apnea (defined as >=15 events/hr) in 54.9%, 31.5%, and 34.5% of the sample, respectively. Sleep apnea was more severe in men (e.g., AHI 3% ≥15 in 61.7% of men and 48.9% of women). Correction for non-representational sampling related to the CREBRF obesity-risk allele resulted in only slightly lower estimates.

	abstract = {In the era of precision health, nursing research has increasingly focused on the analysis of large, multidimensional data sets containing multiple correlated phenotypes (e.g., symptoms). This presents challenges for statistical analyses, especially in genetic association studies. For example, the inclusion of multiple symptoms within a single model can raise concerns about multicollinearity, while individual SNP-symptom analyses may obscure complex relationships. As such, many traditional statistical approaches often fall short in providing a comprehensive understanding of the complexity inherent in many nursing-focused research questions. Multivariate Bayesian approaches offer the unique advantage of allowing researchers to ask questions that are not feasible with traditional approaches. Specifically, these methods support the simultaneous exploration of multiple phenotypes, accounting for the underlying correlational structure between variables, and allow for formal incorporation of existing knowledge into the statistical model. By doing so, they may provide a more realistic view of statistical relationships within a biological system, potentially uncovering new insights into well-established and undiscovered connections, such as the probabilities of association and direct versus indirect effects. This valuable information can help us better understand our phenotypes of interest, leading to more effective nurse-led intervention and prevention programs. To illustrate these concepts, this paper includes an application section covering two specific multivariate Bayesian analysis software programs, bnlearn and mvBIMBAM, with an emphasis on interpretation and extension to nursing research. To complement the paper, we provide access to a detailed online tutorial, including executable R code and a synthetic data set, so the concepts can be more easily extended to other research questions.},

Furthermore, the variation of molecular quantitative traits (e.g., gene expression) could result from the interaction effect of genotypes and phenotypes, but it is challenging to identify such interaction signals in complex disease studies in humans due to small genetic effect sizes and/or small sample sizes.
RESULTS: We develop a novel statistical method, the combined haplotype interaction test (CHIT), which tests for association between molecular quantitative traits and phenotype-genotype interactions by modeling the total read counts and allele-specific reads in a target region. CHIT can be used as a supplementary analysis to the regular linear interaction regression. In our simulations, CHIT obtains non-inflated type I error rates, and it has higher power than a standard interaction quantitative trait locus approach based on linear regression models. Finally, we illustrate CHIT by testing associations between gene expression obtained by RNA-seq and the interaction of SNPs and atopy status from a study of childhood asthma in Puerto Ricans, and results demonstrate that CHIT could be more powerful than a standard linear interaction expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) approach.

              Background
              Following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), the brain is susceptible to ferroptosis, a type of iron-dependent cell death. Therapeutic intervention targeting the iron homeostasis pathway shows promise for mitigating ferroptosis and improving recovery in animal models, but little work has been conducted in humans. DNA methylation (DNAm) plays a key role in gene expression and brain function, plasticity, and injury recovery, making it a potentially useful biomarker of outcomes or therapeutic target for intervention. Therefore, in this longitudinal, observational study, we examined the relationships between trajectories of DNAm in candidate genes related to iron homeostasis and acute (cerebral vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia) and long-term (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS, unfavorable = 1–3] and death) patient outcomes after aSAH.
            
            
              Results
              
                Longitudinal, genome-wide DNAm data were generated from DNA extracted from post-aSAH cerebrospinal fluid (
                n
                = 260 participants). DNAm trajectories of 637 CpG sites in 36 candidate genes related to iron homeostasis were characterized over 13 days post-aSAH using group-based trajectory analysis, an unsupervised clustering method. Significant associations were identified between inferred DNAm trajectory groups at several CpG sites and acute and long-term outcomes. Among our results, cg25713625 in the STEAP3 metalloreductase gene (
                STEAP3
                ) stood out. Specifically, in comparing the highest cg25713625 DNAm trajectory group with the lowest, we observed significant associations (i.e., based on
                p
                -values less than an empirical significance threshold) with unfavorable GOS at 3 and 12 months (

                n
                = 100 participants) observing significant associations with GOS at 3 and 12 months (

                p

                p
                -value {\textless} 0.05 not meeting an empirical significance threshold) with death at 12 months (
                OR
                = 2.0,
                p
                = 0.0272). In both samples, an additive effect of the DNAm trajectory group was observed as the percentage of participants with unfavorable long-term outcomes increased substantially with higher DNAm trajectory groups.
              
            
            
              Conclusion

              Background
              Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is a common secondary complication and an important cause of disability and mortality among patients who survive aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Knowledge on DCI pathogenesis, risk factors, and biomarkers are essential for early detection and improved prognosis. To investigate the role of DNA methylation in DCI risk, we conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) in 68 patients followed up to 1 year after the initial aneurysm rupture. Blood samples were collected within 48 h post hemorrhage and used for DNA methylation profiling at {\textasciitilde} 450k CpG sites. A separate cohort of 175 patients was sequenced for the top CpG sites from the discovery analysis for a replication of the EWAS findings.
            
            
              Results
              
                EWAS did not identify any epigenome-wide significant CpGs. The top signal, cg18031596, was annotated to
                ANGPT1
                , a gene with critical functions in angiogenesis after vascular injury. Post hoc power calculations indicated a well-powered discovery analysis for cg18031596. Analysis of the replication cohort showed that four out of the five CpG sites sequenced at the
                ANGPT1
                locus passed a Bonferroni-adjusted significance threshold. In a pooled analysis of the entire sample, three out of five yielded a significant
                p
                -value, and the top association signal (
                p
                -value = 0.004) was seen for a CpG that was not originally measured in the discovery EWAS. However, four
                ANGPT1
                CpG sites had an opposite effect direction in the replication analysis compared to the discovery EWAS, marking a failure of replication. We carefully examined this observed flip in directions and propose several possible explanations in addition to that it was a random chance that
                ANGPT1
                ranked at the top in the discovery EWAS.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                We failed to demonstrate a significant and consistent effect of
                ANGPT1
                methylation in DCI risk in two cohorts. Though the replication attempt to weaken the overall support of this gene, given its relevant function and top rank of significance in the EWAS, our results call for future studies of larger aSAH cohorts to determine its relevance for the occurrence of DCI.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The minor allele of a missense variant, rs373863828, in CREBRF is associated with higher body mass index (BMI), lower fasting glucose, and lower odds of type 2 diabetes. rs373863828 is common in Pacific Island populations (minor allele frequency (MAF) 0.096-0.259) but rare in non-Pacific Island populations (MAF {\textless}0.001). We examined the cross-sectional associations between BMI and rs373863828 in type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose with a large sample of adults of Polynesian ancestries from Samoa, American Samoa, and Aotearoa New Zealand, and estimated the direct and indirect (via BMI) effects of rs373863828 on type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We regressed type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose on BMI and rs373863828 stratified by obesity, regressed type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose on BMI stratified by rs373863828 genotype, and assessed the effects of rs373863828 on type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose with path analysis. The regression analyses were completed separately in four samples that were recruited during different time periods between 1990 and 2010 and then the results were meta-analyzed. All samples were pooled for the path analysis.
RESULTS: Association of BMI with type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose may be greater in those without obesity (OR=7.77, p=0.015 and β=0.213, p=9.53×10-5, respectively) than in those with obesity (OR=5.01, p=1.12×10-9 and β=0.162, p=5.63×10-6, respectively). We did not observe evidence of differences in the association of BMI with type 2 diabetes or fasting glucose by genotype. In the path analysis, the minor allele has direct negative (lower odds of type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose) and indirect positive (higher odds of type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose) effects on type 2 diabetes risk and fasting glucose, with the indirect effects mediated through a direct positive effect of rs373863828 on BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: There may be a stronger effect of BMI on fasting glucose in Polynesian individuals without obesity than in those with obesity. Carrying the rs373863828 minor allele does not decouple higher BMI from higher odds of type 2 diabetes.},

	abstract = {Identifying high-risk individuals with diseases through reliable prediction models guides screening and preventive treatment. Most complex diseases have a genetic basis influenced by multiple genes and so disease risk can be estimated using polygenic risk score (PRS) algorithms. Many PRS algorithms have been developed so far. Among them, BayesR shows good characteristics of unbiasedness, accuracy, sparseness, and robustness. It detects the associated SNPs, estimates the SNP effects, and makes prediction of disease risks based on all SNPs simultaneously. However, this method assumes that the phenotypes follow a Gaussian distribution, which cannot be met in case-control studies. Here, we made an extension of the BayesR method, called BayesRB, by adding auxiliary variables to the BayesR model. We explored the characteristics, efficacy, and accuracy of BayesRB when estimating SNP effects and predicting disease risks compared with three traditional algorithms under different conditions using both simulated data and real data from the Welcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC). For SNP effect estimation, BayesRB shows unbiasedness and sparseness for big and small effect SNPs, respectively. For disease risk prediction, BayesRB had the best performance among the methods. This study provides a theoretical basis for complex disease risk prediction and disease prevention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension are major contributors to unfavorable prognosis in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Local epigenetic changes, particularly in DNA methylation, may influence gene expression and thus host response/secondary injury after TBI. It remains unknown whether DNA methylation in the central nervous system is associated with cerebral edema severity or intracranial hypertension post TBI. We sought to identify epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns associated with these forms of secondary injury after TBI.
METHODS: We obtained genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of DNA extracted from ventricular cerebrospinal fluid samples at three different postinjury time points from a prospective cohort of patients with severe TBI (n = 89 patients, 254 samples). Cerebral edema and intracranial pressure (ICP) measures were clustered to generate composite end points of cerebral edema and ICP severity. We performed an unbiased epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to test associations between DNA methylation at 419,895 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites and cerebral edema/ICP severity categories. Given inflated p values, we conducted permutation tests for top CpG sites to filter out potential false discoveries.
RESULTS: Our data-driven hierarchical clustering across six cerebral edema and ICP measures identified two groups differing significantly in ICP based on the EWAS-identified CpG site cg22111818 in RGMA (Repulsive guidance molecule A, permutation p = 4.20 × 10-8). At 3-4 days post TBI, patients with severe intracranial hypertension had significantly lower levels of methylation at cg22111818.
CONCLUSIONS: We report a novel potential relationship between intracranial hypertension after TBI and an acute, nonsustained reduction in DNA methylation at cg22111818 in the RGMA gene. To our knowledge, this is the largest EWAS in severe TBI. Our findings are further strengthened by previous findings that RGMA modulates axonal repair in other central nervous system disorders, but a role in intracranial hypertension or TBI has not been previously identified. Additional work is warranted to validate and extend these findings, including assessment of its possible role in risk stratification, identification of novel druggable targets, and ultimately our ability to personalize therapy in TBI.},

A missense variant, rs373863828, in CREBRF is associated with obesity in Polynesians. We investigate whether rs373863828 and other factors are associated with body mass index (BMI) rate-of-change between 2010 and 2017–19 in Samoans.
Methods
We used sex-stratified models to test whether BMI rate-of-change was associated with rs373863828, baseline BMI, age, residence, physical activity, and household asset score in a cohort study of 480 Samoan adults measured in both 2010 (mean age 43.8 years) and 2017–19.
Results
Mean BMI increased from 32.1 to 33.5 kg/m2 in males (n = 220, p = 1.3 ×10−8) and from 35.9 to 37.8 kg/m2 in females (n = 260, p = 1.2 ×10−13). In females, the A allele was associated with a higher rate-of-change (0.150 kg/m2/year/allele, p = 1.7 ×10−4). Across 10-year age groups, mean BMI rate-of-change was lower in older participants. The BMI rate of change differed by genotype: it was, in females with AA genotype, approximately half that seen in GG and AG participants. In females lower baseline household asset scores were associated with a higher rate-of-change (p = 0.002).
Conclusions
In Samoans, the minor A allele of rs373863828 is associated with an increased rate-of-change in BMI in females. On average, BMI of females with the AA genotype increased 0.30 kg/m2/year more than of those with the GG genotype.},

Therefore, here we highlight the benefits of R, an open-source programming language, for scientific data visualization, with a specific focus on creating dynamic, interactive figures using the R shiny package. For R users, we have included a tutorial with example code to create three increasingly complex shiny applications. For individuals more interested in understanding the potential of R shiny as an innovative tool to interact with research data, we have included links to online versions of the examples that do not require any programming or R experience. We believe that widespread adoption of dynamic and interactive scientific data visualization will further support nurse scientists’ higher-level mission of advancing our understanding of health and wellness of individuals and communities.},
